# js-808

A React-based Drum Machine / Sequencer, inspired by the TR-808.

## Demo

https://evening-bastion-13326.herokuapp.com/

(note that the app is slow only because it's deployed to a free Heroku dyno)

## Getting Started

Use NVM to switch to Node v12. Then run `npm i`, and then when that's done run `npm start`.

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Instructions

To play, click the play button, to stop, click the stop button.
Each button represents a time one of the four "instruments" play in the sequencer. You can adjust the sequence by toggling the buttons on and off.

Note that to change the tempo, first you have to stop the sequencer, then change the tempo, then restart.

Have fun!
